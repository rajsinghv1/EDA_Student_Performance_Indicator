# EDA_Student_Performance_Indicator

## Project Overview
This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a student performance dataset to identify factors influencing student success. The analysis includes data preprocessing, visualization, and statistical testing to uncover patterns and relationships between variables such as demographics, parental education, and test preparation.

## Data Collection
The dataset contains student information including:
- Demographics (age, gender, ethnicity)
- Educational background (parental level of education)
- Performance metrics (grades, test scores)

## Data Preprocessing
- Handling missing values by imputation or removal
- Managing outliers using techniques like winsorization
- Encoding categorical variables to numerical formats
- Scaling/normalizing data as needed

## Exploratory Data Analysis
- Descriptive statistics for distribution and spread
- Visualizations: histograms, box plots, bar charts
- Correlation and scatter plots to analyze relationships
- Performance distribution across gender, ethnicity, parental education, lunch type, and test preparation course

## Statistical Analysis
- T-tests and ANOVA for significance testing
- Correlation coefficients to measure relationships
- Hypothesis testing on factors affecting performance

## Insights and Recommendations
- Identification of key factors influencing performance
- Actionable suggestions to improve student outcomes based on findings

## Visualization
Includes bar charts, scatter plots, and heatmaps to present insights clearly.
