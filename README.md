# EDA_Student_Performance_Indicator

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for Student Performance Indicator...

The project aims to analyze and understand the factors that influence student performance in an educational institution. By conducting Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset containing various attributes of students, we can identify patterns, correlations, and insights that can help predict and improve student performance indicators. The project will involve data preprocessing, visualization, and statistical analysis techniques to extract meaningful information.

## Data Collection

Collect a comprehensive dataset containing information about students, such as demographics (age, gender, ethnicity), educational (parental level of education) and performance metrics (grades, test scores).


## Data Preprocessing
- Check for missing values and handle them appropriately (either by imputation or removing rows/columns).
- Handle any outliers in the data by applying appropriate techniques such as winsorization or removing extreme values.
- Encode categorical variables into numerical format for further analysis.
- Perform any necessary data transformations, such as scaling or normalization, to ensure that variables are on a similar scale.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Perform descriptive statistics to understand the distribution, central tendency, and spread of the variables.
- Visualize the data using plots such as histograms, box plots, or bar charts to identify any patterns or outliers.
- Analyze the relationship between variables using scatter plots or correlation matrices.
- Explore the distribution of student performance scores based on gender, ethnicity, parental level of education, lunch, and test - preparation course.
- Identify any significant differences or trends in performance indicators based on these variables.

## Statistical Analysis
- Conduct statistical tests, such as t-tests or ANOVA, to determine if there are statistically significant differences in performance scores based on different variables.
- Calculate correlation coefficients to measure the strength and direction of relationships between variables.
- Perform hypothesis testing to evaluate the impact of variables on student performance.

## Insights and Recommendations
- Based on the analysis, identify key factors that significantly influence student performance.
- Provide actionable insights and recommendations to improve student performance based on the identified factors. For example, determine if gender, ethnicity, parental education, lunch, or test preparation course have a significant impact.

## Visualization
- Create visualizations, such as bar charts, scatter plots, or heatmaps, to present the findings in an easily understandable format.
